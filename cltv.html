									<h3 class="major">What does CLTV mean?</h3>
									<p>CLTV or Customer Lifetime Value is a critical metric in business which represents the total value a customer brings to a business over the entire duration of their relationship. While 
										it can have various interpretations, I'll talk about how I've used it in the past for better budget allocation for customer retention & acquisition. With that being set aside, 
										for a retail or Ecom business it's not just about revenue generated from hisotic or recent purchases but it also covers future purchases & the overall loyalty of the customer. By understanding CLTV,
										businesses can make informed descisions about marketing strategis, customer retention & acquisition efforts , untimately aiming to maximize long term profitablity of the business and customer satisfaction
									</p>
									<h3 class="major">How do I calculate LTV of my current customer base</h3>
									<p>Let's assume we want to calculate Lifetime Value of current customer base of any business, we'll be getting the list of currently active customers (usually rolling 12M), we'll 
										then compute for each customer how many years in the previous 4 years have they been a part of the business, and how often they purchased and how much was the spend in the current year. To make things easier for you
									to visualize, I've attached the sample CSV with randomly generated data with a jupyter notebook. Feel free to download and experiment as required (Sample image of data attached below)
								</p>


									<div class="row gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/CLTV_data.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>

									<br> <br>
									<p> In the screenshot above, for each customer I have added if or not the customer made a purchase in last 5 years where 1 would represent Yes & 0 would be No. 
										Please note that all values of 2023 should be 1 as we are checking for the historic transactions of recent 12M rolling customers </p>
									<h4>We'll now be making following changes to the dataset:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Add a new column Total Lifespan which will be sum of all years from 2023 to 2019</li>
										<li>Add number of marketing communications/ budget spend on each customer</li>
										<li>Calculate LTV for each customer which is defined as <b> Lifespan * Average Transaction Value * Visits, </b>this will tell us how much is a customer likel to spend in next 5 years as per
											their current shopping pattern </li> 
										<li>Aggreagrate the results on Declie and have Customer count, Revenue generated in 2023, LTV in columns</li>
									</ul>
									
									
									<h4>Results after running the code on sample data</h4>
									<div class="row gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/CLTV Summary.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>

									<br> <br>

									<h4>Summary</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>The customers in all deciles received equal amount to communications</li>
										<li>The projected value of customers in bottom 3 deciles is very less, business should spend less money on them as ROI seems to be low</li>
										<li>The projected value of customers in top 3 deciles is quite high, business may increase the frequncy of conatact to keep them engaged</li> 
									</ul>
									

									<p>
										While the above approach was very simple and helped us gague the effictiveness of targeting for course corrections, there can be alternate approchaces to do the same thing. Also, since
										this exercise is does not includes any segmentations, more cohorts to bifurcate customers can be introduced to increase accuracy of Lifespan & see the same data from other lenses. One 
										such example is study the LTV of acquired customers, this will help business understand if the current approach of customer acquisition is getting us premium customers or just explorers!
										<br> <br>
										That's all for this project for now, you can reachout to me via contact page if you have any comments
